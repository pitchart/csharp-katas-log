# Order Shipping (Tell don't ask) Kata
Refactoring Kata, allowing to manipulate multiple concepts and techniques:
 * [Tell don't ask principle](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html)
 * Anti pattern [anemic domain model](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html)
 * Eventually use the [Mikado Method](https://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/mikado.php) or a phase of [Exploratory Refactoring](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/demine-codebase-with-exploratory-refactoring/)
 * Eventually apply the [Tell! Don't ask!](https://kata-log.rocks/tell-dont-ask) constraint
 * Eventually apply the [Object Calisthenics](https://williamdurand.fr/2013/06/03/object-calisthenics/) rules

A kanban, to follow all the refactoring steps you identify, is higly recommended

## How To
You have to take the responsability of an application where the former developers first experimented the clean architecture.
[![Clean architecture schema from cleancoder](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/images/2012-08-13-the-clean-architecture/CleanArchitecture.jpg)](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
This application being responsible of many bugs, you are tasked with refactoring it to make it more maintainable and reliable
